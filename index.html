                                       Chinese calligraphy is a unique art form with great artistic value but difficult to master. In this paper, we formulate the calligraphy writing problem as a trajectory optimization problem, and propose an improved virtual brush model for simulating the real writing process. Our approach is inspired by pseudospectral optimal control in that we parameterize the actuator trajectory for each stroke as a Chebyshev polynomial. The proposed dynamic virtual brush model plays a key role in formulating the objective function to be optimized. Our approach shows excellent performance in drawing aesthetically pleasing characters, and does so much more efficiently than previous work, opening up the possibility to achieve real-time closed-loop control.

In the left, column (g) in the middle picture shows the real written results, and the bottom picture shows the error distribution of the scanned written results. Most strokes of the written results are pretty similar to the reference pictures in column (a);

                                        NILM is mainly about finding the different working states of home electronics
                                        from only their total power consumption. Electtronics such as television,
                                        refrigerator generally have some non-regular consumption pattern with big
                                        randomness (like the figure shows), however, the problem could be approached
                                        with the proposed analyzation tools. In this paper, we propose a new method
                                        based on kernel density estimation(KDE) for low frequency NILM (Non-intrusive
                                        load monitoring). The power consumption features of different kinds of
                                        electronic application are estimated from kernel density estimation. After it,
                                        we establish a simulated dataset which stores the power consumption signal of
                                        different combinations of electronic application. Now, given the total power
                                        consumption data over a period, we divide it into different stages by detecting
                                        step changes, and use a brute-force searching to match each divided stage with
                                        the simulation data to find the corresponding power consumption pattern. The
                                        proposed approach was tested with data from the GREEND public dataset, it showed
                                        good performance (93% accuracy) in the tested data.

                                        In this project, we propose a fast algorithm to achieve both action recognition
                                        and localization in videos. There are mainly three steps: human detection, frame
                                        connection, and single-person action recognition. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The key observation is that the expected output of normal human detection
                                        algorithms is bounding boxes which have continuous image coordinates in adjacent
                                        frames. As such, we propose to directly use bounding boxes as the output of
                                        human detection step but only do the calculation for a small portion of frames
                                        and let interpolation get the detection results for the other frames. The
                                        detected bounding boxes in different frames then constitute sequence with only
                                        one human, and so the action could be detected with a simpler network for higher
                                        calculation efficiency. After the speeding up in the first and third step, our
                                        algorithm calculates at a much faster speed compared with several baseline
                                        algorithms with good detection accuracy.

                                        The project requires assemblying a small vehicle and program to do things like tracing, collision-avoidance, etc. It should be my first project concerned with true robots, and also my beginning of interest on robotics area. </p><p>I also designed a small algorithm to reduce the shaking when it makes a turn. Basically, it detects the turning of the traced trajectory and send the turning command earlier so that it can use a smaller angle velocity to make the turn.

                                        Northeastern University Student Association for Science and Technology (NEUSAST) is one student organization in NEU which mainly concentrates on organizing on-campus scientific-related activities. It is a big organization with many students, also where I stayed for three years. I lead the department of communication and also serves as the vice chairman on 2017. Several of my favoriate activites include "Fly your glider", "Be a creative speaker", "2016 New Year's Day Party", etc. I found many friends there and also learned a lot in these three years' experience, and also appreciate everyone in NEUSAST.

                                        I enjoyed many kinds of music, but the favoriate kind of them should be soft piano music. I began to learn the piano at 10 and stopped at about 16 when I had to left home for the senior high school. The previous six years are very important for me to open the broad world of music. Music expands me another dimension of feeling the world, it is also a chance to express my feeling with many kinds of emotion. I also won the first place prize in a province-level piano competition when I was 15. However, in recent years, I don't have much chance to practice and should be much worse than my childhood level, hahaha.
